# Home Depot Search Relevance Model 

#### by Paul Shao

Shoppers rely on Home Depot’s product authority to find and buy the latest products and to get timely solutions to their home improvement needs. From installing a new ceiling fan to remodeling an entire kitchen, with the click of a mouse or tap of the screen, customers expect the correct results to their queries – quickly. Speed, accuracy and delivering a frictionless customer experience are essential.

In this project, I will help improve their customers' shopping experience by developing a model that can predict the relevance of search results relatively well.

Search relevancy is an implicit measure Home Depot uses to gauge how quickly they can get customers to the right products. Currently, human raters evaluate the impact of potential changes to their search algorithms, which is a slow and subjective process. By removing or minimizing human input in search relevance evaluation, Home Depot hopes to increase the number of iterations their team can perform on the current search algorithms.

### Here is how I break down this project:
1. General Data Overview and Exploratory Data Analysis 
2. Exploring and Evaluating Correlation
3. Data Cleaning and Preparation
4. Applying and Evaluating Model
